# CMPE-272-Assignment1

This project involves the deployment of three (3) Virtual Machines. The task is to configure an Ansible on the controller machine to deploy web servers on VM1 and VM2, listening on port 8080. These web servers will display the message: “Hello World from SJSU - 1 or 2,” depending on whether they are VM1 or VM2.

The project includes the creation of Ansible playbooks to manage both the deployment and removal of the web server resources.

For a comprehensive overview of the setup process and results, please refer to the Word document which contains detailed screenshots and explanations of the work completed. All relevant Ansible code and scripts are available on the associated GitHub repository.
